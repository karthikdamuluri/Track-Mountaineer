# Track-Mountaineer

## Executive Summary
The primary idea behind this project is to develop an application that serves as a great use for **MOUNTAINEERS**. This android app would be handy in tracking temperature and pressure while climbing mountains. A major feature of this application is sending notification during situations of Lowered Barometric Pressure where the heart beat goes below the normal pumping rate. For a better efficiency MetaWear uses Bluetooth low energy device that captures continous activity data. All the data is synced and downloaded to the Mobile device. The downloaded data is represented in a Graphical view for each day using the time timestamp. 

## Project Goals
* Use Login credentials to avoid access to unauthorized users. 
* Track Temperature/Pressure.
* Push Notifications when the barometric pressure is dangerous for human Heart beat.  
* Show a Graphical view of data for each day.

## User stories

As a **mountaineer**, I want to **see climatic changes as I climb**, so I can **be prepared**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
* Track surrounding temperatures
* Track surrounding pressure
* Track surrounding Humidity

As a user, I want to get notifications on my mobile, so I can take care of my heartbeat.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
* Make a threshold pressure value where there is a risk of low pulse rate. 
* Push Notifications to the mobile with a suitable message.
* ~~add one more~~

As a user, I want to track the changes at frequent intervals, so I can check the progress.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
* Store the captured data in the mobile device.
* Make a graphical representation of the data.
* ~~add one more~~
