# Track-Mountaineer

## Executive Summary
The primary idea behind this project is to develop an application that serves as a great use for **MOUNTAINEERS**. This android app would be handy in tracking temperature and pressure while climbing mountains. A major feature of this application is pushing notification during situations of Lowered Barometric Pressure where the heart beat goes below the normal pumping rate. For a better efficiency MetaWear uses Bluetooth low energy device that captures continous activity data. All the data is synced and downloaded to the Mobile device. The downloaded data is represented in a Graphical view for each day using the time timestamp. 

## Project Goals
* Use Login credentials to avoid access to unauthorized users. 
* Track Temperature/Pressure.
* Push Notifications when the barometric pressure is dangerous for human Heart beat.  
* Show a Graphical view of data for each day.
